# consultant-shahruh-task
## Project Background
This project was created as a part of an internship I did during July-September 2021 at a startup called Shahruh Event Technologies. 
As a part of this project, I was given an informal document of software specifications and using this document, I implemented a small CRM System.
## Project Features
A consultant can:
- Add Project
- Add Company
- Add Contact at company
- View complete CRUD of both  
<br/>An admin can do all of that and:
- Add Consultants
Session is maintained using session cookies and all of the information is stored in a mySQL database.
## Code Features
This project uses PHP OOP in the best way, implementing
- Inheritance
- Composition/ Aggregation
- Namespaces
in its code. 
## Running the code
After cloning the repository just create a database of name "consultants_db" and run it on a XAMPP/WAMP server.
